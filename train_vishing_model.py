  This script:
    1. Loads the existing vishing_data.csv
    2. Cleans it (removes bad rows, fixes mislabels, deduplicates)
    3. Adds 400+ realistic synthetic sentences (safe + scam)
    4. Balances to equal class sizes
    5. Encodes with DistilBERT sentence embeddings (768-dim)
    6. Trains Logistic Regression with train/test split
    7. Reports accuracy, F1, confusion matrix, cross-validation
    8. Saves final model as logistic_vishing_model.pkl

  Usage:
    python train_vishing_model.py
